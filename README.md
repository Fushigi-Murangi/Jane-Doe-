    <!-- Act 1 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Act 1 — “Glass Rain”</h2>
      <p>The street was empty. Or at least, it appeared so. Jane walked with a quiet steadiness, the soft scrape of her shoes against wet asphalt almost swallowed by the sound of falling rain. She held a clear umbrella above her head, catching the dim, flickering glow of streetlights.</p>
      <p>At first glance, it seemed like a normal downpour. But looking closer, Jane’s eyes traced the tiny shapes falling around her: sharp, fragmented shards that caught the light like broken glass. Each droplet tinkled against her umbrella with a delicate, eerie chime. She didn’t flinch. Didn’t move differently. She just walked.</p>
      <p>The bus stop loomed ahead, its flickering fluorescent tube casting pale, uneven light across the cracked concrete. A car passed, headlights slicing through the night, and for a moment, the rain seemed to intensify. And then—when the light retreated, when the car was gone—Jane was gone, too. The bus stop sat empty under the dull hum of the city, waiting.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>She woke in a bathtub, the water lukewarm at first, then thickening, darker with each passing second. She tried to find the source of the blood on her skin, but it was elusive, slipping beneath her gaze, hiding, as if mocking her. Giving up, she stood. The water clung to her legs, sticky and red, as though trying to anchor her in place. She stepped out, letting it fall away in thick rivulets, leaving faint stains across the floor.</p>
      <p>She moved through her morning in a series of minor disasters. The hairdryer fell, grazing her foot. The seam of her coat split quietly, almost imperceptibly. Hot oil hissed as it struck her wrist, and a drip from the ceiling nearly made her slip on the slick tile. When she cut the onions, the blade nicked her finger, a shallow graze she barely noticed. The eggs burned slightly, but she ate them quickly, mechanically, and left.</p>
      <p>Outside, the world was muted, gray. A piece of crumpled money lay at her feet, and she picked it up. At the convenience store, she bought a single piece of candy, feeling the cashier’s uneasy stare settle on her like a weight. In the background, the TV blared a news report about another homicide. She didn’t pause. She didn’t react.</p>
      <p>Her steps carried her to work, the crowded streets swallowing her presence. Faces brushed past her, bodies shifting around her like water. For a brief, unsettling moment, she seemed to vanish entirely, blending seamlessly with the blur of movement. And then, without warning, she reappeared—lying in a field of flowers, grass soft against her fingers.</p>
      <p>Here, for the first time, her face was fully visible, pale and unreadable, framed by strands of damp hair. She lay back, letting the petals brush against her skin. The city, the accidents, the blood—they were distant echoes now.</p>
      <p>And still, no word had passed her lips.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Act 2 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Act 2 — “Echoes of Control”</h2>
      <p>Jane woke slowly, the familiar ache of cold and damp clinging to her skin. She wasn’t in the field anymore. The room was dark, shadows pooling in the corners, her wrists heavy against an invisible weight. She blinked, and the world twisted.</p>
      <p>When her eyes opened again, she was in her bed. Morning sunlight spilled across the floor. The birds outside chirped, and for a fleeting moment, the day felt ordinary. She moved to the window. Clouds had returned, grey and oppressive, stretching across the horizon. Nothing felt right.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>At work, Jane slid into her routine. The convenience store smelled faintly of coffee and bleach. Customers came and went, hands pressing coins and notes into her palms. The scanner’s beep echoed in her ears, mechanical, precise. Beep… beep… beep…</p>
      <p>Her lips remained sealed. Not a single sound escaped. She moved, scanned, counted, repeated. Behind her, a monitor hummed. Somewhere between reality and perception, the words on a medical chart started to shift. Letters twisted, floated, then danced away, leaving her staring at blank paper.</p>
      <p>When her shift ended, the streets were dim and unfamiliar. She hadn’t charged her phone. No one around. Time felt elastic. The muted hum of the city pressed against her ears.</p>
      <p>A dog wandered into view. Small, thin, lost. She paused. Memories flashed—her hands reaching for other animals before, each time met with fear, aggression, or apathy. She hesitated. The dog stared, tilting its head, then ran toward her as if it had been waiting all along.</p>
      <p>A boy came running. Fourteen, short breath, clutching a broken leash. Relief washed over him when he saw the dog by her side.</p>
      <p>“Hey… have I… seen you before?” His voice was soft, hesitant, a lifeline in the mechanical rhythm of her day.</p>
      <p>She stopped. Confused. Her mind tried to measure the moment, find a proper response.</p>
      <p>“I’m a local cashier, after all,” she said, the words strange even to her own ears.</p>
      <p>“No… you’re not…” the boy muttered, frowning.</p>
      <p>A voice echoed then, disembodied and cold, slithering through the air around them:</p>
      <p>“…not someone you want to know.”</p>
      <p>Jane’s eyes snapped open. The world shifted. She was back in the flower field. The grass brushed her fingertips again, soft, unreal. Distant voices whispered across the field, carried by a wind she couldn’t feel.</p>
      <p>Finally, she spoke aloud, her own voice raw and steady:</p>
      <p>“Jane Doe.”</p>

    <!-- Act 3 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Act 3 — “Fractured Loops”</h2>
      <p>The camcorder hissed as the tape rolled. Jane’s younger self, five years old, sat holding a birthday cake. Candles flickered, casting tiny, uneven shadows across her face.</p>
      <p>“Happy birthday to you…” whispered a voice, soft, almost loving.</p>
      <p>A man stepped into the frame, his presence heavy and cold.</p>
      <p>“Jane…” he said.</p>
      <p>A sharp crack split the air. Jane’s eyes widened. The camera shook slightly as the voice screamed in agony.</p>
      <p>“Jane.” The man repeated, calm, methodical.</p>
      <p>The scream tore the frame apart. The birthday candles danced, then went out. Jane’s vision blurred, darkness swallowing her completely.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Present Jane stood at the sink, washing dishes, her movements precise and empty. A familiar, distorted echo floated around her: “Happy birthday, dear…”</p>
      <p>Her hands paused. The dead, blank expression she wore daily finally flickered with something raw, almost recognition. Her shoulders stiffened, the kitchen silent except for the water dripping slowly into the sink.</p>
      <p>She walked through town. Her body moved among the crowds like a ghost, passing through shoulders, skirts, and coats as if she didn’t exist. At the bus stop from the other night, she collided with a man. Solid. They didn’t meet eyes. The man muttered something like an apology and walked on, leaving Jane staring after him. Distracted, she didn’t see the car barreling toward her. CRASH.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The room shifted again. She was stripped, bound to a chair. Cold. Starving. Counting seconds, heartbeats, breaths. A man entered, placing vials of supplements and nutrients in her reach, just out of grasp. His voice was soft, intimate.</p>
      <p>“I know you love me.”</p>
      <p>“I… I…” she tried to speak.</p>
      <p>“Sshhh… you need to take your nutrients.”</p>
      <p>Panels of her mind fractured: walls stretching, words dancing and melting, time splitting.</p>
      <p>Then an explosion. Flames and debris filled the sky. And Jane crawled from the wreckage—herself, but not herself. Her body ached, her mind fractured further. She stumbled into the flower field again. The soft grass offered no comfort. She pressed her face to her knees, shivering, tears streaming down her cheeks. Darkness seemed to creep along the horizon, pressing in from all directions.</p>
      <p>“I’ll find… you…” she whispered, broken and determined.</p>

    <!-- Act 4 -->
    <section>
      <h2>Act 4 — “The Mirror of Jane” (Finale)</h2>
      <p>Jane woke in her bed. Blood. So much blood. Her limbs were soaked, dripping, but when she searched her body, she found no wounds. No source. Only the sticky warmth and the metallic smell filling the air.</p>
      <p>“He got another one,” a voice whispered in her skull. Somewhere. Somewhere far away.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Elsewhere, a picnic unfolded. A man, familiar but impossibly distant, sat with a pretty woman and a dog. Laughter spilled across the grass, casual, bright, normal. Yet the dog stiffened, hackles rising, a low growl vibrating in its throat.</p>
      <p>Jane appeared behind them. The dog barked, both at her and at the man. And then, in a blur of movement too fast for the eye, the man drew a pistol with a silencer. The dog’s bark cut short. The woman froze. Panic painted every line of her face.</p>
      <p>The man’s eyes found Jane for just a second, and something in the recognition froze her blood. He began counting. She remembered: the man she had bumped into, days ago, now revealed fully as predator.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>The woman ran. Her legs burned, her arms stung with blood from each bullet. Tears mixed with dust and dirt as she dragged herself, leaving a trail across the field. The man followed methodically. Each shot precise, calculated. Pain stretched time into long, jagged panels of horror.</p>
      <p>He reached her. Knife drawn, dragging the steel along her abdomen, careful, controlling, savoring. Jane lay beside her, silent, watching. Gasoline hissed over her trembling body. A cigarette, lit, smoke curling into Jane’s vision, dropped. Flames licked the woman’s skin. Her eyes found Jane’s. A shared moment of terror. And then she was gone.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>She left her apartment. Her feet left bloody prints, dragging over wet asphalt. She knew, somehow. “I know…”</p>
      <p>The house she approached was old, sprawling. Memories clawed at her: the fire, the explosion, the camcorder, the birthday screams. An old woman passed her, smiling, then pausing. “Aren’t you… the one who was… last time? Are you really there?”</p>
      <p>Jane’s mind flickered. She remembered the news, the missing students, the image of the man. Years compressed into an instant. She had seen him, prepared, but she hadn’t stopped him yet.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>She woke again. Naked, tied to a chair. The dark room smelled of antiseptic, decay, and fear. “You must really want to go home, huh?” the man said. She whispered to herself: “Two thousand four hundred and fifty-four… two thousand four hundred and fifty-five…” He smiled, cold, and touched her face. Slow. Gentle. Possessive. Dragged his hand down her bare body. “You’re beautiful.” Behind him, corpses posed like grotesque dolls, frozen in eternal agony. Jane’s stomach lurched, a silent scream rising in her throat.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Chaos descended. The man moved with urgent precision, foaming at the mouth, blade in hand. Jane froze as fire licked the edges of the room, filling it with smoke and roaring heat.</p>
      <p>“You never told me your name,” she whispered. “Ha—herro, skir,” she stammered.</p>
      <p>Her body twitched, shuddered, trying to escape. “Don’t you move now, Jane Doe.”</p>
      <p>He stabbed her leg, cutting the ropes loose. She screamed, clawed at the chair, dragging herself to her feet. The knife slashed her wrist, freeing her hands. Gas fumes stung her eyes.</p>
      <p>“9… and 10. Ready or not… here I come,” he hissed. He lunged. Tight grip. Whispered, cold: “I know you love me, Jane.”</p>
      <p>Pain exploded through her stomach as the blade met flesh. Desperation, adrenaline, raw will — she rammed her broken wrist bone into his skull. He stumbled, writhing, and Jane forced herself upright. The gas ignited. Flames roared. The house detonated in a storm of fire and iron, debris, and screaming metal. Jane stumbled outside, burning, bleeding, but alive.</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Her feet dragged across town, streaked with blood. Every step a testament to survival. She collapsed into a flower field. At first, it seemed calm. Soft grass. Muted petals.</p>
      <p>Then, the horror revealed itself. As the camera pulled back, the ground was littered with corpses — all Jane. Every angle, every shadow, every body a mirror of her, but none truly hers. The flowers bloomed pale, soaked in red. Wind whispered, distant voices calling her name. Jane lay still, shivering, silent. Eyes open. Wide. Watching.</p>
